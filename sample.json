    "name": "Sales Rep",
    "employer": "Wealthtechs Inc",

    "description": "Hi, I am Chris, the CEO of WealthTechs, a market leading, early stage FinTech with 75 high profile, referenceable customers with over $1 trillion in assets. Our product is in the wealth management financial account data aggregation space. Here's my standard explanation of who we are and what we do.\n\n\"WealthTechs is a financial data technology company providing custodian data processing solutions to investment advisors, custodians and fintechs serving advisors.\u00a0Advisors require daily customer account data from custodian banks and broker dealers to feed their mission critical IT tech stack systems like: portfolio accounting, compliance, trading, reporting, billing and CRM.\u00a0WealthTechs\u2019 custodian data aggregation and normalization platform coupled with WealthTechs\u2019 intelligent data transformation software seamlessly integrates with most popular advisor systems such as InData, Orion, Paxus, Axys, APX, Geneva, AssetBook, Portfolio Center, WealthSite, or advisor\u2019s other systems using our API or SFTP file delivery systems.\u00a0WealthTechs\u2019 customers\u2019 bottom line is where we shine.\u00a0Due to our innovative technology and deep cost savings, customers exponentially increase their profits over the long term by lowering the total cost of ownership of custodian data and reconciliation labor by 50% or more versus our competition.\u00a0WealthTechs guarantees it!\"\n\nI\u2019m looking for a sales rep to help me to sell to new customers. The ideal candidate has done complex B2B enterprise sales before, knows the process of cold calling, emailing, LinkedIn connections, influencing on LinkedIn, running trials/pilot tests, persistence, patience and most importantly: selling benefits and not showing up and throwing up. Again, let me be very clear, this is a B2B sale, so the ideal candidate must understand the needs of businesses; no MLM types allowed!!!\n\nIn my experience; there are 2 reasons businesses buy new tech, 1) it saves money or 2) it makes money. The great thing about this job is you get to sell a solution that does both, and the competition does not. The sales cycle is relatively long, but it\u2019s a super sticky sale and customers typically stay for years, if not for life. Also it\u2019s a complicated sale, so the ideal candidate must be able to handle details, learn the product, the industry and the implementation process that assures our customer success. The target market we sell to are registered investment advisors, custodian banks & broker dealers. The nice thing about this industry is it is government regulated, so all of the key contacts at the firms we sell to are registered on the federal government web site. We also sell to fintechs that sell their products to the same market because they need our data to fire up their apps. Fintechs obviously are not government regulated, so their contact info is not on a government website. We have built our own CRM that contains all of this info, but it needs to be updated constantly as people and companies change all the time. This requires that you are in periodic contact with prospects to assure you are working with the right people. We are super vigilant about updating CRM so we all know what's going on with any customer at any point in the sales cycle.\n\nThe ideal candidate, although it\u2019s not absolutely necessary has experience selling tech to our market and knows the intricacies of investments such as stocks, bonds, options, funds and other publicly traded securities. If you know that stocks pay dividends and bonds pay interest, that's a good start! If you are an actual investor, or have a professional investment advisor managing your money, that's even better. For the right person, this is a great opportunity to get in at the ground level of a potential $1 billion company, learn a valuable skill set and build a long lucrative career. We have gotten the business to first base, I need you to help take it to second. Just so you know what you\u2019re getting into, the first job that you will do after learning the basics of our business is setting up appointments with prospective customers This involves cold calling. Once you book the appointment, I will do all the talking and presenting on the call and you will listen in and learn. Over time, you\u2019ll be able to do these calls and presentations on your own. I\u2019m looking for a smart worker who is not scared of learning something new and really wants a career, not a paycheck. If you are smart, you will probably be taking sales from start to finish with minimal input from me within 6 months.\n\nCompensation will grow with your experience and the ability to do things on your own without being micromanaged. The starting salary of $60-90K for the job is exactly that, starting salary. If you thrive at this job, bring in business, build relationships with customers and resellers, assure their success through the implementation and ongoing management of the accounts, up sell new products to your customers; your salary could grow exponentially, easily exceeding $200k per year.\n\nOur company is a tight knit group of nice, intelligent, smart, hard-working people, we are really family more than business associates. I live and work from my home in Sandy, Utah and I would very much like to hire someone local if possible, but it is not absolutely critical if you are the right person. I do think working together in person makes it much faster and easier to get up to speed. Of course, we need to respect Covid and make sure that safety comes first.\n\nAs you can tell from this detailed job description, I am dead serious about finding the right person for this job. If everything works out, stock options, management, opening an office, whatever you want is possible.\n\nIf this sounds like you, please reach out to me and let\u2019s talk."

    "description": "Most of our clients have called us their cleaner for several years and we are very careful about who we take on as a client as well as who we are willing to hire as a cleaner. It's important to us that everyone involved is happy and feels respected and appreciated by their cleaner/client relationship and of course by us. The way we do business is different than other companies. We charge by the job instead of by the hour. That way if you've had a lot of coffee, or what have you, and are buzzing around, you don't get punished for being quicker and more efficient. Likewise, if you are feeling tired and working slow, the client doesn't get punished by paying more. We have this down to a science and it really works better in our opinion. The minimum amount we charge for a small house or apartment is $50 and the employee receives 45% of that. After 6 months, based on performance, you will get a 5% raise to the full half cut of the profit. This is at least double of what any other cleaning company pays their employees. We have literally been made fun of by other cleaning companies for paying our employees such a high percentage. We do it because Kat knows from 16 years of cleaning, what hard work being a house cleaner is, and honestly believes good employees deserve good money. So you will get a $15 minimum per house and up to $100 for a regular client cleaning. A new client or move-in cleaning pays the employee $50 all the way up to $200+. The company's portion goes to providing all your supplies, covering insurance, bonding, payroll fee's, advertising and of course managing current and seeking out new clients. This is actually an excellent split and close to double of what most companies pay their cleaners. Even if you clean half as slow as the veterans of the team, you should still make around $15-$20 per hour. We are ready to start training immediately. Ideally, the owner, Kat, would clone herself but the next best thing is finding an employee who will be fit to join the Kat's Cleaning family. Send us an email with your resume and professional references in order to apply. You may also call with any questions to see if this would be a right fit for you.\u00a0"

    "description": "Are you tired of working at customer service jobs? Would you prefer working for a family-owned company rather than being \u201cjust a number\u201d in the corporate environment? Would you like to start investing in yourself for the future? Well, we\u2019re hiring!\n\nJob Title: PERS Weekend Graveyard Shift Emergency Telephone Responder\n\nJob Description\n\nPERS (an Ogden Hazmat Compliance Company) seeks a full-time employee (32-40 hours per week, with benefits) for weekend day shift coverage to handle emergency telephone calls involving companies regulated by the USDOT which ship or transport hazardous materials. This position is currently comprised of two 12-hour shifts, 7pm-7am, Saturday and Sunday, and 1-2 flexible shifts during the week (we can discuss this in further detail in a more formal interview setting). These are the hours. All weekend, every weekend. If this is your style, know that we offer a competitive wage along with a performance-based raise after just 90 days!\n\nResponsibilities\n\nResponsibilities and duties include answering telephone calls pertaining to Domestic and International shipments of hazardous materials where emergency response information or other safety information is needed for the material due to an incident. It sounds a bit intimidating, but we will properly train an applicant. The call volume is very low during these scheduled shift hours: so you\u2019ll be assigned some extra tasks and also need to be able to keep yourself entertained for most of the shift (outside projects, i.e., schoolwork, hobbies, etc., are authorized with prior approval).\n\nQualifications\n\nIt is critically important that our telephone responders interact with callers in a positive and professional manner. Responders must strive to always be respectful, courteous, and confident. Applicants must be reliable, mature, honest, detail oriented, and able to learn and follow procedures. Sometimes callers are in a stressful situation.

    "description": "Do yourself a favor and read this.\n\nDon\u2019t be mislead by unachievable incentives and or CRAZY sign on bonuses. The higher the sign on bonus, the higher the desperation. These company\u2019s don\u2019t pay the full bonus up front knowing that chances are that the new hire won\u2019t stay in the seat long enough to collect it in full. It\u2019s just bait to get you in the door.\n\nI do provide a $500 start bonus just to help with getting back on your feet if you\u2019ve been between jobs. These big company\u2019s have high turn over rates due to the \u201cdeal with it\u201d attitude from managers that\u2019s never been in the seat, and from being paired up with a steering wheel holder. We only hire professionals so you\u2019ll be paired up with a professional, not a slob with a bad attitude.\n\nWe\u2019re straight shooters, sadly, some are dishonest or misleading as many of you already know. Some advertise .65 cents per mile, Do yourself a favor and ask to see a complete and current payroll. Most will decline your request or give you the run-around. You\u2019ll generally find the .65 to be unachievable. Or very few drivers within the company that actually make that. These rates are made up of either fuel conservation incentives and mileage threshold incentives that are typically not realistic.\n\nOur drivers average $1,500 - $1,700 or more a week with a payroll to back it up, plus benefits and bonuses.\n\nMost of my hiring is done by word of mouth from current happy drivers. We\u2019ve just added 3 trucks and have just 2 seats left.\n\nI have 1 solo position available for a Reefer truck.\n\n1 part time local position available, 2 nights a week and a solo run\n\nHusband and wife teams are welcome, Have a buddy? Bring him with you and we'll put you in your own truck with no bouncing around. Plus a referral bonus.\n\nFowles Investments has been contracting with FEDEX GROUND since 2000.\n\nWe maintain a happy work environment and back up our drivers. I do not tolerate bad attitudes. You won\u2019t find any here.\n\nWe are large enough to accommodate time off and provide flexibility but small enough to work with you on a personal level. Be respected and treated like a professional, not a number.\n\nBoth managers have been OTR and know trucks and the business, We have the lowest turnover rate out of the salt lake city terminal. We have several drivers that have been with us for 10 years plus and others that have retired happily with us.\n\nFed Ex Ground has the smoothest logistics in the biz, this equals more miles and less time on the road.\n\n*Home every weekend*\n\n*Top Pay Rates.\n\n*New Fleet.\n\n*100% Drop & Hook, Terminal to Terminal, No Touch Freight.*\n\n*Full Health Insurance / Dental / Vision / Benefits Package after 30 days.\n\n*Yearly Vacation Pay.*\n\n*Safety / performance Bonus of up to $850.00 + paid every 6 months.\n\n*Clean D.O.T Inspection Bonuses.\n\n*NO forced dispatch, we are flexible if you have personal business to attend.\n\n*Paid hotels and layover pay in the event of a layover. (RARE)\n\n*Paid satellite radio with wireless headsets.\n\n*Upgraded pillow-top mattresses.\n\n*Fridge in every truck.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a CDL or enough experience, I can enroll you in school to get you started in a new exciting and fruitful career. I\u2019ll pair you with a well seasoned trainer with a great attitude.\n\nCall or text Jared @ (801) 710-3938 and I\u2019ll be happy to answer any of your questions. Thanks"
